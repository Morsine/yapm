## YAPM
Yet Another Power Manager

## What does it do?
With this, you can toggle between relays, using only one button.

There's also code for automation using a temperature sensor.

This code was written to control fanspeed of a 220v AC fan (which had multiple inputs giving different speeds)

This project uses the following libraries:


https://github.com/bigjosh/OneWireNoResistor

https://github.com/greiman/SSD1306Ascii

https://www.arduinolibraries.info/libraries/dallas-temperature

And the following hardware:

1- an arduino uno (you probably can use whatever you want)

2- DS18B20 (Code implemented by: https://wp.josh.com/2014/06/23/no-external-pull-up-needed-for-ds18b20-temp-sensor/)

3- 4 Replay module

4- SSD1306

5- a button, really.
